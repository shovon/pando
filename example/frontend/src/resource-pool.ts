/**
 * Creates a resource pool for allocating values associated with a key.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     // An example associating a MediaStream to a pool of `HTMLVideoElement`s
 *     const pool = createWeakResourcePool<MediaStream, HTMLVideoElement>(
 *       () => document.createElement('video')
 *     );
 *
 *     // For some `stream` that we were given access to.
 *     const video = pool.allocate(stream);
 *
 *     // Laterâ€¦
 *
 *     pool.deallocate(stream, video);
 *
 * The benefit of the resource pool is that if you lose access to the key, the
 * resource associated with the key will garbage collect itself, and thus
 * avoiding memory and resource leaks.
 *
 * However, this is not a guarantee against memory leaks. If the key is still
 * being referenced, all allocated (but unused) resources will remain in memory.
 * And thus, care needs to be taken when invoking the `allocate` method.
 * Additionally, the `deallocate` method does not delete a resource; it merely
 * "flags" it as "unused", so that the `allocate` method will opt for returning
 * the "unused" resource, rather than to initialize an entirely new resource.
 *
 * Only non-primitive reference types allowed as keys (i.e. objects, functions,
 * regular expressions or anything initialized using the `new` keyword are
 * perfectly allowed). What is NOT allowed are primitive types, which are
 * booleans, numbers, and strings.
 * @param create The function that will be used for creating the item that will
 *   be placed in the pool
